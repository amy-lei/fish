# Online Fish
Fish—but online—for those booted out of campus.

## Motivation
Fish was a [card game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature_(card_game)) that I used to play with friends back on campus. Due to COVID-19, however, my first year on campus was cut short, and we became scattered across the country. Given that this game was an integral part of our time together (as a destressor/our form of "breaks" from problem sets), I wanted to digitize it to help maintain the interactions that being on campus together offered—to keep us connected.
